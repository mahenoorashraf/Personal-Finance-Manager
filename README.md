# Personal-Finance-Manager
Python CLI based Personal Finance Manager Project

📌 **Project Overview**
The Personal Finance Manager is a Python-based console application that helps users manage daily expenses efficiently. The project allows users to add expenses, view records, generate reports, and store financial data using CSV files.
